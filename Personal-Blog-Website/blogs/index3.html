      <h1 class="blog-heading">TOP 10 MARKETING TIPS FOR YOUR ONLINE COFFEE BUSINESS</h1>
      <img class="blog-img"src="..\assets\img\Marketing-Coffee.jpg" alt="">
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Coffee is a different outlet to many — to some, it is a morning pick-me-up, while to others, it is a chance to socialize,
        and to others still, it is a source of business. The coffee industry continues to grow as the demand increases. According to the National Coffee
        Association, 41% of American adults drink specialty coffee daily, and the average amount of coffee for American coffee drinkers is nearly three
        cups per person. Coffee businesses are also changing to meet the new needs of customers who are on the go. Online coffee businesses are a source
        for online shoppers, mobile users, and other buyers to conveniently purchase their favorite caffeine source.</p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Online coffee businesses allow many to work from home selling coffee. However, growing your business requires advertising
        strategies and website optimization. If you are looking for the best practices to sell coffee from home, you need to alter your business to fit
        emerging trends and the habits of your potential customers. These coffee marketing ideas and tips will give your business direction and practical
        steps for successful progress.</p>
      <h2 class="blog-subheading">1. CONNECT WITH CUSTOMERS THROUGH CONTENT MARKETING</h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Putting out helpful and informative content that relates to coffee brewing methods, drink recipes, and new roasting trends attracts website visitors.
        Content marketing traditionally includes blogging, but videos and podcasts also count as useful material that leads customers to your website.
        Generate interesting blog posts and videos that feature your products in fresh ways.</p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Along with truly useful content, make sure it is shareable. Before producing a new post or video, ask yourself, is this something my potential customers
        would want to pass on to their friends and acquaintances? Many content marketing management tools exist to help you come up with topics and make
        connections in the coffee world.</p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Be consistent in releasing content, so your visitors have a reason to come back to your website and become a return customer.
        You create trust when you establish your brand as an authority on coffee trends, the best appliances to enhance
        taste and texture, or guides on grinding consistency. Create a schedule for your content and the measures you will take to market your website.</p>
      <h2 class="blog-subheading">2. EXPRESS YOUR COFFEE BRAND PERSONALITY</h2>
      <img class="blog-img" src="..\assets\img\01-Brand-Personality-min.jpg" alt="">
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Your brand communicates the values and character of your company, but it also leaves a distinct impact with viewers who will associate images
           and product with your business. Choose how you want your online business to be remembered. Separate yourself from the competition by selecting
           a strong and memorable brand personality.</p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Do you want people to think of your coffee as their lifeline for every busy morning and an on-the-go necessity? Or do you want people to associate
           your brand with a cozy cup of joe shared with their family? After you establish your voice, style, and tone, don’t divert from them. Each time your
           website visitors read a new blog post or see a new social media photo, you want them to feel like they are talking to an old friend or rooting for
           a favorite representative.</p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Make your online coffee business a quirky, energetic voice in this caffeinated industry or make it an elegant, high-end perspective. Organic or indulgent,
            youthful or timeless, ensure your brand is identifiable — then express that personality in your website, social media, powerful packaging, and captivating
            advertisements.</p>
