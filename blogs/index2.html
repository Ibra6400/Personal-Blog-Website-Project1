      <p class="blog-paragraph">With countless coffee brewing methods available to us today, you may be wondering:
        “Does it really matter if my morning cuppa comes from a French Press, or a drip coffee machine? And what the heck is a percolator?”</p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Any coffee lover would agree that the method you use to brew your beans does make all the difference in the aroma,
        texture, freshness, andtaste you end up with in your cup.</p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">he coffee brewing method you use can also determine the nutritional value and the amount of antioxidants in your java,
        and may even help reduce your exposure to the carcinogenic chemicals that occur with certain coffee brewing techniques.</p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Let’s look closer at the key differences, and benefits, in eight different coffee brewing methods so that you can decide
        which one is right for you.</p>
      <!-- First Brewing Method -->
      <h2 class="blog-subheading">French Press</h2>
      <div class="image-caption">
        <img class="blog-imgcaption" src="..\assets\img\french-press.webp" alt="">
        <p>One of the simplest brewing methods that steeps coffee grounds in hot water and then presses the grounds out.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- Benifits of using Frensh Press -->
      <h3>Benefits:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="benefits-list">The coffee beans only come in contact with the French Press and hot water (opposed to passing through a filter), which yields
          a stronger cup of coffee in terms of caffeine content and flavor.</li>
        <li class="benefits-list">A glass or stainless steel French Press is considered one of the “cleanest” coffee brewing methods, because it doesn’t use the
          bleached paper coffee filters that contain chemicals, called dioxins and epichlorohydrin, which become carcinogenic when they
          come in contact with water.</li>
        <li class="benefits-list">“Boiled” coffee brewing methods help preserve the antioxidants found in coffee beans, such as chlorogenic acids. Chlorogenic acids
          are the reason why coffee is said to have protective effects against Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and dementia.</li>
        <li class="benefits-list">The strength of brew in a French Press is easy to customize.</li>
      </ul>
