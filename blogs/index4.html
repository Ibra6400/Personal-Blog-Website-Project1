      <h1 class="blog-heading">A Beginners Guide to Coffee Grinders</h1>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">The purpose of this section is to let you in on all the little things that you don’t normally hear about coffee grinders.
         I may be a little long winded in some of my explanations but I am trying, in the only way I know how, to cover a lot of content in a way that it
         is thorough and accurate.</p>
      <h2 class="blog-subheading">How Grinders Affect the Coffee: </h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Grinding coffee is a violent thing. The coffee is taken from its nice friendly home in its bag or can and put into a bean hopper,
         which by itself is not a bad place. But then the grinder is turned on and you immediately hear the sound of the motor and the burrs spinning wildly as
         the coffee starts to be ground into small particles. This is where the action takes place and is the start of your coffee experience.</p>
      <h3>Heat</h3>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">The final result of your espresso/coffee will depend upon how evenly your coffee is ground and it’s final temperature after grinding. Yes that’s right, as the coffee is ground it will pick up heat and the more heat your coffee picks up the more adversely it will affect your final product. If you are only grinding enough for a double shot the coffee will not pick up much heat from any grinder. The more coffee you grind the hotter the coffee gets due to the grinding burrs and surrounding parts getting hotter.</p>
      <h3>Static</h3>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Another possible byproduct of grinding coffee may be the dreaded static charge that can cause the ground coffee to literally jump
        out of the ground coffee container. You would have to see it to believe it. Have you ever noticed your hair standing on end after donning your wool sweater?
         No it’s not a ghost, it’s a static charge.The static charge forms when the coffee is ground and then forced through a chute and into a receptacle.
         Factors that affect this ghostly phenomenon are the speed of the grinding burrs, the way in which the coffee exits through the chute,
         humidity, temperature and the coffee itself. It is pretty hard to control most of these factors but it is easy to control which grinder you purchase.
          As a rule, the grinders that produce the most static charge and add the most heat to your fresh ground coffee are the high-speed grinders.
           Read our blog to learn more about the difference of high-speed vs low-speed grinders.</p>
      <h3>The Size of the Grind</h3>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">What we are talking about now is how fine or how coarse your coffee is ground. The size of the grind you will need is directly
          related to the type of equipment used in brewing your coffee, how fresh the coffee is, and how it is roasted.
          Different types of espresso/coffee machines are designed to extract flavor and aroma from the coffee in a different way.
          Therefore they require a different size grind. The following will provide guidelines to help you understand what you will
           need to get the best out of your espresso/coffee machine.</p>
